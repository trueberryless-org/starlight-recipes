description: Learn how Starlight Recipes' rating system works and what you need to set up.
---

Starlight Recipes integrates a rating system based on [Countify](https://countify.xyz/).
Every user can submit one vote from one to five stars and the average stars together with the count of votes will be shown on overview pages and recipe pages.

In this guide you will learn what you need to do to enable this rating system.

## Setup rating system

import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import GuidGenerator from '@/components/GuidGenerator.astro';

<Steps>

1. In order for the rating system to work, you need to have any [Astro Server Adapter](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/on-demand-rendering/#server-adapters) setup.

2. Additionally, you must generate a random GUID and set the environment variable `STARLIGHT_RECIPES_RATING_SECRET` to this string.
   This GUID acts as a secret to prevent people from guessing the Countify ID so they could spam ratings.

   Click on this button to generate a random variable for you:

   <GuidGenerator />

   :::danger
   If you change this GUID, all your ratings will be reset as a different GUID represents another namespace.
