title: Frontmatter
---

You can customize individual recipes by setting values in their frontmatter which is set at the top of your files between `---` separators:

```md
---
// src/content/docs/recipes/virgin-colada.md
title: Non-Alcoholic Piña Colada
cover:
  alt: A beautiful Virgin Colada
  image: ../../../assets/virgin-colada.png
---
```

## Extend your frontmatter schema

Starlight Recipes extends [Starlight's frontmatter schema](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/frontmatter/) with information about the recipe.
You need to update the content config file in order for the additional recipe-specific fields to be available:

```diff lang="ts"
// src/content.config.ts
import { defineCollection } from 'astro:content';
import { docsLoader } from '@astrojs/starlight/loaders';
import { docsSchema } from '@astrojs/starlight/schema';
+import { recipesSchema } from 'starlight-recipes/schema'

export const collections = {
  docs: defineCollection({
    loader: docsLoader(),
    schema: docsSchema({
+      extend: (context) => recipesSchema(context)
    })
  }),
};
```
