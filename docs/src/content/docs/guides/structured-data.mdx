title: Structured Data
description: Learn how Starlight Recipes uses the frontmatter data from each recipe to generate informative JSON content for Google.
---

Starlight Recipes automatically generates [structured data](https://schema.org/Recipe) for each recipe route to enhance discoverability on [Google](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/recipe) and other supported services.
Specifying the [`site` property](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/configuration-reference/#site) in your Astro config is required to generate canonical URLs for your assets, making them accessible to web crawlers.

This guide explains the benefits of this convention and which properties will be generated from your frontmatter.

## What is structured data?

[Structured data for recipes](https://schema.org/Recipe) enables machines to better understand your content and display it in various ways. Here is an example for how a recipe could look like with this convention:

```json collapse={23-79}
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org/",
  "@type": "Recipe",

      ],

    },
    "expires": "2024-02-05T08:00:00+08:00"
    }
}
```

For example, Google will use such JSON to feature your recipes directly on Google Search results and Google Images.

Structured data is widely used among different services. Some further examples include [Apple](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Conceptual/AppSearch/WebContent.html), [Bing](https://www.bing.com/webmasters/help/?topicid=da2b3faa) and [Pinterest](https://help.pinterest.com/en/business/article/rich-pins).

## Supported properties

import DocField from '@/components/DocField.astro';

Starlight Recipes mainly focuses on [Google-supported and -recommended properties](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/recipe#structured-data-type-definitions) as Google's convention is the most influential -- though this is likely a mix of market dominance, [citogenesis](https://xkcd.com/978/) and a "[Reiteration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusory_truth_effect) Loop".

### `name`

<DocField
  description="The name of the dish."
  linkedProperty="title"
  link="https://starlight.astro.build/reference/frontmatter/#title-required"
  backlinking={true}
/>

### `image`

<DocField
  description="Image of the completed dish."
  linkedProperty="cover"
  backlinking={true}
/>

Starlight Recipes will use the cover image to generate three images with the following aspect ratios for [best results](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/recipe/#:~:text=aspect%20ratios): 16x9, 4x3, and 1x1.
